#### Ingredients
* 1½ lb Italian sausage
* 24 oz spaghetti sauce *(I prefer Prego Roasted Garlic & Parmesan)*
* 8oz canned diced tomatoes
* Cup or two of red wine
* 1 package no-boil lasagna noodles *([Barilla makes one](http://www.barilla.com/content/product/oven-ready-lasagne))*
* 16 oz Mozzarella cheese log
* Spices: basil and/or Italian seasoning, pepper, red pepper flakes, garlic powder
* Optional: more cheese

#### Supplies
* Rectangular baking pan (preferably stoneware) with good depth
* Large skillet
* Aluminum foil
* Cooking spray

#### Let's Do It!

In a large skillet on medium-high heat, brown and break up the Italian sausage until nearly cooked. You can leave larger chunks of sausage, but smaller pieces is better. Lower to medium heat and add the spaghetti sauce using the red wine to help swig all the good sauce out of the jar, plus a little extra. Add the diced tomatoes (do not rinse or drain), and add in seasonings to your preference, don't afraid to go heavier than you think. Reduce heat to a low simmer to let the wine cook.

Heat the oven to 375ºF. By the time the oven is heated

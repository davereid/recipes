#### Ingredients

* 1/4 cup (50 g) white sugar
* 1/4 cup (50 g) brown sugar
* 1/2 cup (125 mL) water
* 4 cups (1 12-oz package) fresh or frozen cranberries
* 1 orange
* pepper

#### Supplies

* Colander
* Medium saucepan
* Spatula

#### Let's Do It!

1. Zest the orange and save it for later. Juice the orange and reserve.
1. Place the cranberries in a colander and rinse them. Pick out and discard any damaged or bruised cranberries.
1. Combine the water, orange juice, brown and white sugar in a medium saucepan on high heat and bring to a boil. Stir to dissolve the sugar.
1. Add the cranberries to the pot and return to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 10 minutes or until most of the cranberries have burst.
1. Once the cranberries have burst, add a pinch of pepper and the orange zest to taste. And add additional sugar if wanted.
1. Remove the pot from heat. Let cool completely at room temperature, then transfer to a bowl to chill in the refrigerator. Note that the cranberry sauce will continue to thicken as it cools.

#### Customizing

Some people also like adding raisins or currants, or even blueberries for added sweetness. You can also add holiday spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, or allspice.

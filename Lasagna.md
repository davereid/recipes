# Lasagna

#### Rundown
* I don't mess with boiling noodles. Because I'm lazy. It could probably be tasty if you used "real" noodles but whatevs.
* I don't use any additional salt or oil, so yay?
* We only use Mozzarella cheese since my wife finds Ricotta gross. I think this makes this recipe special and different. Feel free to add in additional cheese of your liking.
* Sometimes I double this recipe and bake one in a foil pan which I freeze for later. Just make two separate pans, not one giant pan of lasagna.

#### Ingredients

* 1½ lb Italian sausage
* 24 oz spaghetti sauce *- I like using Prego Roasted Garlic & Parmesan, don't give me that look*
* 8oz canned diced tomatoes
* 8oz canned tomato sauce
* 1 cup (or two) of red wine
* 1 package no-boil lasagna noodles *- [Barilla makes one](http://www.barilla.com/content/product/oven-ready-lasagne)*
* 16 oz Mozzarella cheese log
* Spices: basil and/or Italian seasoning, pepper, red pepper flakes, garlic powder
* Optional: more cheese

#### Supplies
* Rectangular baking pan (preferably stoneware) with good depth
* Large skillet
* Aluminum foil
* Cooking spray

#### Let's Do It!

In a large skillet on medium-high heat, brown and break up the Italian sausage until nearly cooked. You can leave larger chunks of sausage, but smaller pieces is better. Lower to medium heat and add the spaghetti sauce and tomato sauce using the red wine to help swig all the good remnants out of the jar or can. Plus a little extra wine, it's just between us. Add the diced tomatoes and then add in seasonings to your preference, don't afraid to go heavier than you think. Reduce heat to a low simmer to let the wine cook.

Heat the oven to 350ºF. Take your Mozzarella log, and **very thinly** slice it into circles. Try to cut as many as possible, but you want at least 30. Wipe your knife periodically to help slicing. By the time the oven is heated the meat and sauce mixture will have simmered enough. Taste this again and add more seasoning if needed.

With a shallow ladle or scoop, spoon a layer of mostly sauce, but a little meat into the bottom of your baking pan until it mostly covers the entire surface. Lay 3 pieces of the lasgna noodles on top, spread out but try not to touch the sides. They will expand as it cooks. On top of the noodles, place six evenly spread cheese circles. When we have extra cheese (like shredded Mozzarella), I fill in the spaces around the circles. Then spoon more of the sauce and meat mixture on top of each cheese circle. Repeat this four more times so that you have five complete layers. When putting on the very top layer of sauce and meat mixture, make sure it covers all the exposed noodle. Sprinkle a little extra Italian seasoning or basil on top. Spray a sheet of aluminum foil with cooking spray, and place it spray-side down on and around the pan, sealing it nice and good.

Cook for one hour. I usually like to just turn the oven off to let it rest about 5 minutes.
